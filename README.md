# SlackFolders Userscript

Installation:
For Chrome, use Tampermonkey https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/tampermonkey/dhdgffkkebhmkfjojejmpbldmpobfkfo?hl=en
It's technically possible to install userscripts directly to Chrome, but (deliberately) a somewhat significant pain.

For Firefox, use Greasemonkey https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/greasemonkey/

Each extension has instructions for adding a userscript. I've gotten as far as copying and pasting from here ... there is a way to link it from GitHub that I just haven't figured out yet...
